# Fallout-76-ini-tweak-scipt
### 16x the detail, 16x less framerates
Command line python script to make quick changes to the ini config file. MUST be run as admin since it has to change access permissions of the file. <br />
<br />
Allows for preset optimizations of the ini to boost framerate, or reset to defaults if you didn't like the changes. Miscellaneous tweaks such as uncapping framerate*, disabling startup video, disabling main menu music and finally changing FOV.
<br />
### "Uncapping" Framerates
Although it stops the game from capping you at a horrible 36, 48 or 60 fps cap, you have to ensure the game doesn't run above 120 (or 130/144 according to some sources?) fps with your graphic driver or else things start to fall apart. 
<br />
### Changing FOV
The minimum is 70 FOV and the maximum is 120 FOV. Default is minimum, which is ridiculous because its like you're half blind on the outer edges of both eyes in real life.
